# BookLibrairyProject

My very first full stack app, using Sql server, Entity framework code first migration as API, React and css as frontend, this app is an assignment from Salt bootcamp where i had 24 hours to build a full stack app doing CRUD operations and being responsive design.
I decided to make a simple application for children to share with others the books and stories they had read and share their opinion about them. As it is often difficult to choose which book to read, the application offers a book to read among the various books already published in the application.
