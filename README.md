My very first full stack app, using Sql server (Azure DataStudion v1.41.2) , Entity framework code first migration as API (.Net 7.0) , React and css as frontend, this app is an assignment from Salt bootcamp where I had 24 hours to build a fullstack CRUD applicaion  and being responsive design.

I decided to create a simple application for children to share with others the books and stories they had read and share their opinion about them. As it is often difficult to choose which book to read, the application offers a book to read among the various books already published in the application.

Initialy I had three tables user,Books and Opinions.For that assignment I have decided to have focus on the one to many relation between Books and Opinions first and managing the corresponding CRUD operations before going further with the User table.
